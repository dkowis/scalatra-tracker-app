# Scalatra Tracker App #

Porting over the tracker app from scala play to scalatra.

The play framework support in cloud foundry needs some help before I can actually use it.


## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd Scalatra_Tracker_App
$ ./sbt
> jetty:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
